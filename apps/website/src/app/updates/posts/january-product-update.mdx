First off, thank you for an incredible 2024. Since launching our public beta in May, we’ve onboarded over 12,000 businesses something we’re incredibly proud of.

We’ve been working tirelessly to bring all the features we’ve promised but we’re just getting started. Here’s what’s coming next:
<br />

 
#### Stability & Improvements
We’ve been moving fast and that comes with a cost. Our focus now is on refining and improving key areas.

#### Bank Connections
Neoai currently integrates with three bank providers. We’re adding two more; Enable Banking for Europe, and Pluggy in Brazil. This will bring more stability and expand coverage across the EU and Brazil.

#### Inbox Matching
We’re improving transaction matching with receipts and invoices, making the inbox feature even smarter. Over time it will learn from your patterns ensuring greater accuracy. Plus we’re rolling out UI updates for a smoother experience.

<br />

#### Bug Fixes & Small Improvements
Thanks to your feedback we have a prioritized list of bugs and refinements that we’ve already started tackling. Keep the feedback coming!

#### Mobile App
We have big plans for mobile ensuring you can stay on top of your business anytime anywhere with key insights and actionable tools. Viktor is working on bringing the design to life. Here’s a sneak peek more details soon.

<br />

#### Assistant v1
Our AI assistant is evolving. It will include memory and learn from your workflows making it more action-driven by suggesting tasks before you even ask. This also lays the foundation for our upcoming mobile app.

<br />

#### API & SDKs
Many of you have asked for more ways to integrate Neoai into your workflows. We’ve partnered with Speakeasy to offer SDKs in TypeScript, Python and Go along with expanded API access.

<br />


#### Multi-Language Support
We’re making Neoai available in multiple languages across the entire platform so you can work in the language that suits you best. To make this seamless we’re using Trans our own AI-powered localization tool ensuring accurate and dynamic translations.

<br />

#### What’s Next?

We’re aiming to be out of beta in two months and can’t wait to bring Neoai to even more businesses worldwide.

Once again thank you for all your support and feedback. Neoai is shaped by you. Feel free to reply to this email we read every message.
