#### Vault

The Vault is now your intelligent, self-organizing hub for all financial documents.

Our new Cmd + K global search lets you search across transactions, invoices, documents, and more from anywhere in the app. Just hit Cmd + K (or Ctrl + K on Windows) and start typing to jump directly to what you need, whether it’s a specific invoice, a client, or a document buried deep in your Vault. No more clicking through menus or losing time everything is just a keystroke away.
