# Markdown

Trans supports Markdown file localization, perfect for documentation, blog posts, and content-heavy sites. This format preserves Markdown syntax while translating content, including front matter support.

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a trans.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "md": {
      "include": ["content/[locale]/**/*.md"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx trans@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Trans will:

- Load your source Markdown files (e.g., content/en/*.md)
- Detect any new or modified content
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language files (e.g., content/sv/*.md)
- Preserve Markdown formatting and structure
- Handle front matter translations
- Maintain links and references
- Keep code blocks untranslated
- Preserve HTML within Markdown
