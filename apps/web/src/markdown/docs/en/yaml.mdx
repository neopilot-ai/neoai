# YAML

Trans supports YAML files as a source format, which is commonly used in Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and other frameworks. This format supports nested structures, arrays, and complex data types.

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a trans.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "yaml": {
      "include": ["config/locales/[locale].yml"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx trans@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Trans will:

- Load your source YAML file (e.g., config/locales/en.yml)
- Detect any new or modified translation strings
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language YAML files (e.g., config/locales/sv.yml)
- Preserve nested structures and formatting
