# CSV

Trans supports CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files for simple translation management. This format is ideal for spreadsheet-based workflows and easy integration with external translation tools.

---

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a trans.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "csv": {
      "include": ["translations/[locale].csv"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx trans@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Trans will:

- Load your source CSV file (e.g., translations/en.csv)
- Detect any new or modified translation strings
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language CSV files (e.g., translations/sv.csv)
- Maintain column structure and formatting
- Preserve any additional metadata columns
