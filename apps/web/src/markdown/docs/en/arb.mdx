# ARB (Application Resource Bundle)

Trans supports ARB files, the standard localization format for Flutter applications. This format handles plurals, placeholders, and select expressions while maintaining compatibility with Flutter's intl package.

---

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a trans.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "arb": {
      "include": ["lib/l10n/intl_[locale].arb"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx trans@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Trans will:

- Load your source ARB file (e.g., lib/l10n/intl_en.arb)
- Detect any new or modified translation strings
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language ARB files (e.g., lib/l10n/intl_sv.arb)
- Preserve metadata, placeholders, and plural/select expressions
