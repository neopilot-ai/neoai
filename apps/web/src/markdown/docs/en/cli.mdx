## Overrides for source locale

Sometimes you may want to get overrides for the source locale. For example, as a developer you might add translations in en.json but want to have spell checks, overrides and maintain consistent tone with other languages. You can enable this by adding your source locale to the target locales as follows:

```bash title="trans.json"
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": [
      "sv",
      "en" <- Add your source locale here
    ]
  },
  "files": {
    "json": {
      "include": [
        "src/locales/[locale]/*.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

## Delete translations

The `translations delete` command is used to delete all target translation files and remote translations from your project. This is useful when you want to start fresh or remove all translations.

```bash title="Terminal"
    npx trans@latest translations delete
```
