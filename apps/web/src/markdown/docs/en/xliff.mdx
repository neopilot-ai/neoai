# XLIFF

Trans supports XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format), an XML-based format designed for exchanging localization data. This format is widely used in professional translation workflows and supports both XLIFF 1.2 and 2.0 versions.

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a trans.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "xliff": {
      "include": ["locales/[locale].xlf"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx trans@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Trans will:

- Load your source XLIFF file (e.g., locales/en.xlf)
- Detect any new or modified translation units
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language XLIFF files (e.g., locales/sv.xlf)
- Preserve notes, context information, and state attributes
- Maintain compatibility with CAT (Computer-Aided Translation) tools
