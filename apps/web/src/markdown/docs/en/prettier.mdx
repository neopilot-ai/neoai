# Prettier

Trans can work together with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure your translation files are consistently formatted. This is particularly useful when working with JSON translation files that need to maintain a consistent style across your project.

## Using with Trans

The recommended way to use Prettier with Trans is to format your translation files after they're generated. You can set this up in your `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "translate": "trans translate",
    "format": "prettier --write \"locales/**/*.json\"",
    "translate:format": "npm run translate && npm run format"
  }
}
```

Now you can:
- Run `npm run translate` to only generate translations
- Run `npm run format` to only format existing translation files
- Run `npm run translate:format` to generate translations and format them in sequence
