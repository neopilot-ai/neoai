# GitHub Actions

With the github action, you can easily translate your code by just pushing your code to the repository, the github action will then translate your new keys, either create a pull request or commit your changes.
This saves you a lot of time and effort while maintaining high quality translations.

---

## Installation

To use the Trans GitHub Action in your repository, you'll need to:

1. Set up your repository secrets with your Trans credentials
2. Create a workflow file in your repository

### Setting up Repository Secrets

Add the following secrets in your repository settings (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions):

- `TRANS_API_KEY`: Your Trans API key
- `TRANS_PROJECT_ID`: Your Trans project ID

You can find these values in your Trans dashboard under Project Settings.



### Environment Variables

The GitHub Action uses the following environment variables:
- `TRANS_API_KEY` (Required): Your Trans API key for authentication
- `TRANS_PROJECT_ID` (Required): Your Trans project ID 
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Required): Automatically provided by GitHub, used for creating PRs

### Example Workflow

Create a new file .github/workflows/trans.yml in your repository with the following content:

```ts title=".github/workflows/release.yml"
name: Deploy Website

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'
    paths:
      - apps/web/**

jobs:
  translate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Trans Action
        uses: trans-ai/trans@v1
        env:
           GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.TRANS_API_KEY }}
          project-id: ${{ secrets.TRANS_PROJECT_ID }}
```
 
 This workflow will:
- Run on pushes to the main branch
- Run on pull requests to the main branch
- Can be triggered manually from the Actions tab
- Checkout your code and run the Trans translation process
- Create a pull request with any new translations (configurable)

#### Working Directory Option

The `working-directory` option allows you to specify where your translation files are located. This is particularly useful in monorepos where your translations may be in a specific package or app directory. For example:

#### Pull Request Option (coming soon)

The `create-pull-request` option controls whether the action creates a pull request with the changes or commits them directly to the branch:

```typescript title=".github/workflows/trans.yml"
with:
  create-pull-request: true # create a pull request with the changes
```

When set to `true`, the action will:
- Create a new branch with the changes
- Create a pull request for review
- Add appropriate labels and description

When set to `false` (default), the action will:
- Commit the changes directly to the current branch
- Push the changes without creating a pull request

## Using with Vercel

If you're using Vercel for deployments, you can combine this GitHub Action with our [Vercel build validation](./vercel) to ensure your translations are always synchronized before deployment. This prevents deployments with missing or outdated translations.
