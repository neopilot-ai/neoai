# HTML

Trans supports HTML file localization, handling both text content and attributes. This format is ideal for static websites and HTML templates, with support for preserving HTML structure and formatting.

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a trans.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "html": {
      "include": ["pages/[locale]/*.html"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx trans@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Trans will:

- Load your source HTML files (e.g., pages/en/*.html)
- Detect any new or modified translation strings
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language HTML files (e.g., pages/sv/*.html)
- Preserve HTML structure and formatting
- Handle specified attribute translations
- Maintain comments and special tags
