# XML

Trans supports XML file localization, suitable for various XML-based configuration and content files. This format handles complex XML structures while preserving formatting and attributes.

---

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a trans.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "xml": {
      "include": ["resources/[locale]/*.xml"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx trans@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Trans will:

- Load your source XML files (e.g., resources/en/*.xml)
- Detect any new or modified content
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language files (e.g., resources/sv/*.xml)
- Preserve XML structure and formatting
- Handle attribute translations
- Maintain CDATA sections
- Keep XML comments
- Support XML namespaces
- Validate XML structure
