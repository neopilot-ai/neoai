# FTL (Fluent)

Trans supports FTL files, Mozilla's Fluent localization system. This powerful format handles complex translations including variables, selectors, attributes, and terms while maintaining a human-readable syntax.

---

## Setting Up

First, make sure you've got a trans.json config file in your project root. Here's an example:

```json title="trans.json"
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["sv", "de", "fr"]
  },
  "files": {
    "ftl": {
      "include": ["locales/[locale].ftl"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Translating

With your config set, run:

```bash
npx trans@latest translate
```

When you run this command, Trans will:

- Load your source FTL file (e.g., locales/en.ftl)
- Detect any new or modified translation strings
- Generate translations for your target languages
- Create or update the target language FTL files (e.g., locales/sv.ftl)
- Preserve all FTL features including:
  - Variables and placeholders
  - Selectors for plurals and other variants
  - Attributes
  - Terms and references
  - Comments and metadata

## FTL Features
