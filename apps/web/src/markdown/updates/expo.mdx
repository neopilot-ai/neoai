We're announcing our new Expo Preset, designed to make translating your Expo applications. With support for TypeScript and native translations, you can localize your entire app with minimal configuration.

## Quick start

Get started in seconds with our preset:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx trans@latest init --preset expo
```

## Key Features

- **Native Translation Support**: Seamlessly handle platform-specific translations for iOS and Android
- **Automatic Directory Structure**: Pre-configured folder structure for both web and native translations
- **Dependency**: Automatically installs required dependencies
- **Configuration**: Automatically configures your project for localization

## How It Works

1. Initialize your project with the Expo preset
2. Define your translations in JSON files
3. Use the i18n instance to translate your app

## Example Usage

```typescript title="src/components/MyComponent.tsx"
import { useTranslation } from './locales/i18n';

function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  
  return (
    <Text>{t('welcome.message')}</Text>
  );
}
```

## Native-First Approach

Our Expo preset helps you with the challenges of mobile app localization. Store platform-specific translations in dedicated files:

```bash title="Structure"
locales/
  ├── en.json          # Shared translations
  ├── native/
  │   ├── en.json      # Native-specific translations
  │   └── es.json
  └── es.json
```
