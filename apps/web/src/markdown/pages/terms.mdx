# Terms and Conditions

*Last updated: January 26, 2025*

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your relationship with the Trans application (the "Service") operated by Neoai Labs AB ("us", "we", or "our").

Please read these Terms carefully before using our Service.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you may not access the Service.

## 2. Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide us with accurate and complete billing information, including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

## 3. Fee Changes

We may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions at our sole discretion and at any time. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

## 4. Refunds

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by us on a case-by-case basis and granted at our sole discretion.

## 5. Content

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share, and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

You agree that this license includes the right for us to make your Content available to other users of the Service, who may also use your Content subject to these Terms.

You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other rights of any person.
